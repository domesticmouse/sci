/// The widget surveyor creates synthetic widget trees to hold the widgets it
/// measures. This is important because if the widgets (or any widgets in their
/// subtrees) depend on any inherited widgets (e.g. [Directionality]) that they
/// assume exist in their ancestry, those assumptions may hold true when the
/// widget is rendered by the application but prove false when the widget is
/// rendered via the widget surveyor. Due to this, callers are advised to
/// either:
///
///  1. pass in widgets that don't depend on inherited widgets, or
///  1. ensure all inherited widget dependencies exist in the widget tree
///     that's passed to the widget surveyor's measure methods.

  /// The build context that's passed to the `builder` argument will represent
  /// the root of the synthetic tree.
